# cleandata
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 

## Steps to create the tidy data set

1. download the .zip file from the location provide. 
2. unzip raw data and put all the required datafiles in the same folder
4. open a R console(Iused 32 bit R) and set the working directory to the directory where the datafiles are stored
5. source the run_Analysis.T script to create the output file.
